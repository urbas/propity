ERR_EXPORT_INVALID_SD_FOR_ML=Cannot export to Isabelle/HOL ML-SNF format. The diagram has to be a simple implication.
IMPLICATION_TAUTOLOGY_DESCRIPTION=The "implication tautology" rule takes a compound spider sub-diagram of the form "\u03c6 \u27f6 \u03c6" and converts it to a null spider diagram.

RULE_IMPLICATION_TAUTOLOGY_NOT_APPLICABLE_SEM=The implication tautology rule is not applicable on the selected compound diagram. The given compound spider diagram is of the form: A --> B, but the semantic equivalence of A and B could not have been established.
RULE_DISCHARGE_NULL_GOAL_NOT_APPLICABLE=The selected subgoal could not have been discharged. The subgoal was not a null diagram.
DISCHARGE_NULL_GOAL_DESCRIPTION=This rule checks whether the selected subgoal is a trivial tautology (i.e. a null spider diagram) and removes it from the list of goals.
